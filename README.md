# Hotel-Recommendation-Engine
We aimed to create a hotel recommendation system by working with the sentiment analysis of old customerâ€™s reviews of different hotels in a city, so that the client finds the best suited hotel in just a click. The recommendations will be made according to the specific need of the user.


Running the last User Interface cell will display a window as follows:-

When the appropriate city and filter is added, we get the following output:-
