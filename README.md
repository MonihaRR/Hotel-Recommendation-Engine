# Hotel-Recommendation-Engine
We aimed to create a hotel recommendation system by working with the sentiment analysis of old customerâ€™s reviews of different hotels in a city, so that the client finds the best suited hotel in just a click. The recommendations will be made according to the specific need of the user.

Dataset:

We picked up a dataset from Kaggle which was originally scraped from booking.com and has roughly around 515,000 rows and 1492 luxury hotels spread across six cities in Europe. Dataset link - https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe

Result:

Running the last User Interface cell will display a window as follows:-
